<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Kuro!</h1>

- I'm here, on github to customize some cogs for my Red -  Discord Bot, [Kiki](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=886547720985264178&scope=bot&permissions=2251673160%20applications.commands).

- My Customized Cogs:

  - [Kiki](https://github.com/Kuro-Rui/Kiki) - A Fork from Red's General cog (Customized for Kiki✨)

  - [Kiki-CommandSearch](https://github.com/Kuro-Rui/Kiki-CommandSearch) - A Fork from jack's SearchCommands cog (Unapproved) which I made the cog info more family friendly.

  - [Kiki-Flare](https://github.com/Kuro-Rui/Kiki-Flare) - A Fork from flare-cogs.

  - [Kiki-Trusty](https://github.com/Kuro-Rui/Kiki-Trusty) - A Fork from Trusty-cogs.

- I'm mostly online on discord to find, add, and test new features/cogs for my bot everyday.

<!---This is a ✨special✨ repository because it appears on GitHub profile.--->
