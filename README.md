<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Kuro!</h1>

- I'm here, on github to customize some cogs for my Red -  Discord Bot, [Kiki](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=886547720985264178&scope=bot&permissions=2251673160%20applications.commands).

- My Customized Cogs:

  - [kiki-trusty](https://github.com/Kuro-Rui/kiki-trusty) - A Fork from Trusty-cogs.

  - [kiki-commandsearch-by-jack](https://github.com/Kuro-Rui/kiki-commandsearch-by-jack) - A Fork from jack's SearchCommands cog (Unapproved) which I make the cog info more family friendly.

- I'm mostly online on discord to find, add, and test new features/cogs for my bot everyday.

<!---This is a ✨special✨ repository because it appears on GitHub profile.--->
